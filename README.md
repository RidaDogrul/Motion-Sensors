# Motion-Sensors
The Android platform provides several sensors that let you monitor the motion of a device. Two of these sensors are always hardware-based (the accelerometer and gyroscope), and three of these sensors can be either hardware-based or software-based (the gravity, linear acceleration, and rotation vector sensors)
